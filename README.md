# Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Milestone 1
- Trained a vision classifier in Teachable-Machines and created four classes, "Rock", "Paper", "Scissors" and "Nothing". The model was created with different views and distances. The model will be loaded into the program to illicit a response based on whether Rock, Paper or Scissors is shown.

## Milestone 2
- In this milestone, the virtual environment ,Conda. The following dependancies were installed: tensorflow, open-cv
- I then tested the model locally without any conditions and added keras.h5 model to the code.

## Milestone 3
- Created the logic for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game with only user input and no cmaera input.
- 4 functions were created:
    - Get computer choice
    - Get user choice
    - Get winner
    - Play

## Milestone 4
- Game logic with camera input
- Basic UI

## Conclusion
- Leaned how to set up a Conda environment and accepting inputs for a camera.
