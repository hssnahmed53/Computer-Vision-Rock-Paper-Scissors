# Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Milestone 1
- Trained a vision classifier in Teachable-Machines and created four classes, "Rock", "Paper", "Scissors" and "Nothing". The model was created with different views and distances. The model will be loaded into the program to illicit a response based on whether Rock, Paper or Scissors is shown.
